2. Click the green **Code** button located at the top right of this repository.
3. In the dropdown menu, select **Download ZIP**.

You can now open the project files locally and start working with them.

## 2. **Clone or Fork the Repository (For Advanced Users)**

If you're familiar with Git, cloning or forking the repository is a more flexible option. This will allow you to stay up to date with the latest changes and contribute to the project directly. 

<!-- Cloning: You get a local copy of the repository (on your computer), but you're working directly with the original repo. If you want to contribute to the original, you'll either need write access or need to fork it.
Forking: You get a personal copy of the repository on GitHub under your account, and you have full control over this copy. From there, you can create a pull request to propose changes back to the original repo.
-->

### **Cloning the Repo**:
<!-- You'll get a local copy of the repository. -->

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
2. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the project.
3. Run the following command:
```bash

```
Once cloning is complete, navigate into the project folder:
```bash
cd insightnet-workshop-2024
```

### **Forking the Repo**:
1. In the top right corner of this Github repository, click the Fork button.
2. Once the repository is forked, you can either:
   - **Clone** your forked version to your local machine by using GitHub Desktop or the terminal:
