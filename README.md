Development notes.

### Organization

* Top directory controls the website.
* Any directory beginning with `_` will not be built.
* In the top directory, I put code files that I will source (or call in other
places) in `_code/`. 
* Same goes for the `slides/_code/`: it's a good place for long scripts to be
used inside the `.qmd` files. But it's helpful to name them similar to the
code chunk in which they're used.
